For example, if you have an equation with 0X + 0Y + 2Z, this becomes a powerful tool to eliminate Z from the other 2 equations because X and Y is zero and has no effect.

This problem occurs because two equations are not independent and they are just derivations of another. In this case, you really only have information for two equations, so it is natural that you don't have enough information to solve for all three variables."
