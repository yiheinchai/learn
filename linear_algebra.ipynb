For example, if you have an equation with 0X + 0Y + 2Z, this becomes a powerful tool to eliminate Z from the other 2 equations because X and Y is zero and has no effect. In the end, you keep doing eliminations until you have only 1 variable per equation."

    "### Time complexity on matrix multiplications\n",
    "\n",
    "As per previous implementatin of elimination as shown above, we use a recursive algorithm where we apply the same elimination steps to n-1 size matrix over and over again until we obtain a 2 x 2 matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each elimination steps requires to make the entire column 0. So if each column has n rows, then we need to make n rows 0. Now to make each row 0, we need to use the multiplier on each item of the row and the subtract. Assuming the multiplication and subtraction can be considered as 1 operation, then if there are n items on each row, this means that there is n x n operations for the first elimination step for the first column.\n",
    "\n",
    "considering that there are n columns, this estimates to n x n x n or n^3 operations. However, we need to consider that every column this is less and less rows and columns because we only take a smaller subset of the matrix to do the elimination steps as shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "So it looks something like:\n",
    "n^2 + (n-1)^2 + (n-2)^2 + ... 2^2\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate this, we can integrate with respect to x from x=2 to x=n like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "integrate(x^2, from=2, to=n)\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of integration entails adding one to the power and dividing by the new power, so integration of n^2 becomes 1/3 n^3. \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the time complexity of the right handside (b), because there is only 1 column, it becomes 1 x n x n when it is n^2."

    "\n",
    "For a 3 x 3 identity matrix, there are 6 permutations by swapping the positions of the 3 rows round, 3 x 2 x 1 = 6. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a 4 x 4 identity matrix, there are 24 permutations by swapping the positions of the rows around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that multiplying any of the matrix with another withiin this group will always result in another matrix in the group. This is because since the group contains all permutations of swapping the rows around, and each item in the group applies an operation to swap the rows, multiplying one matrix of the group with another matrix of this same group will still result in the swapping of rows, which we know that the group already encompass all possiblities, and henceforth the resultant matrix will still be part of the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the inverses of the matrix will also be itself, because the to reverse and exchange of rows, we simply do the exchange of rows again."
