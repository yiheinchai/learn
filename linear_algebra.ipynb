    "Elimination of linear algebra is the basic process of eliminating all the variables from a equation that you have 1 variable left. For example, if you have an equation with X, Y, Z variables, you can use the other equations to knockout X, Y variables such that you have Z left. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most text, they will teach to use a certain position as a pivot, but it really doesn't matter. Just do whatever it takes to eliminate the variables, you can subtract from any position as long as it serves the purpose in eliminating the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, you can observe that once you have eliminated one equation to only have 1 variable, you can then use that equation to eliminate the other equations. For example, if you have an equation with 0X + 0Y + 2Z, this becomes a powerful tool to eliminate Z from the other 2 equations because X and Y is zero and has no effect. In the end, you keep doing eliminations until you have only 1 variable per equation."

    "Intuitively, elimination will fail when you eliminate more than 1 variable when you subtract. This will cause it to fail because you will end up with a eqution with X isolated, Y isolated, but none with Z isolated, because you accidentally eliminated Z together with another variable. This problem occurs because two equations are not independent and they are just derivations of another. In this case, you really only have information for two equations, so it is natural that you don't have enough information to solve for all three variables."
