    "Moreover, you can observe that once you have eliminated one equation to only have 1 variable, you can then use that equation to eliminate the other equations. For example, if you have an equation with 0X + 0Y + 2Z, this becomes a powerful tool to eliminate Z from the other 2 equations because X and Y is zero and has no effect. In the end, you keep doing eliminations until you have only 1 variable per equation."

This problem occurs because two equations are not independent and they are just derivations of another. In this case, you really only have information for two equations, so it is natural that you don't have enough information to solve for all three variables."
